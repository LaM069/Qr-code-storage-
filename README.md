# UNLIMITED YOUTUBE STORAGE

This project is a video-to-QR-code converter that allows users to encode video files into QR codes. The generated QR codes can be shared on platforms like YouTube or any other medium, and users can then decode the QR codes to retrieve the original video.

### Features

- **File Encoding:** Convert files of diverse formats into QR codes.
-    **Extension Preservation**: Remember the original file extension to ensure seamless decoding.
-  **Sharing**: Facilitate easy sharing of files by distributing QR codes.
- **Compatibility**: Support for a broad range of file formats.
- **Decoding**: Clear instructions for users on how to decode QR codes and retrieve the original file.

### Installation

 Download or clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AkhilAndroid/https://github.com/AkhilAndroid/unlimited-youtube-storage.git
  cd unlimited-youtube-storage
```

     virtualenv env
     ```

   **OR**

   - Create a Python Virtual Environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```

 Activate the Virtual Environment.

   - On Windows.

     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux.

     ```bash
